	|| Bitcoin Venezuela Extension ||
	=================================

A Chrome extension/plugin that modifies Coinbase's dashboard and send web pages to add market prices of Bitcoin in VEF (Bol√≠var).

Purpose: to help Venezuelan users and contribute with Bitcoin adoption.

Todo list:

0.- Plugin was made using the web version of Coinbase. Responsive design wasn't considered. Plugin must be fixed to "survive" changes on tablet/mobile screen sizes

1.- After clicking button to Send Funds, form modifications are lost due to DOM changes, even when hitting back. Confirmation amount should also contain VEF amount as primary.

2.- Add ETH exchange rates

3.- Add angular real time field binding instead of basic JS binding

4.- Check code: development was made and first working version was released. Code isn't optimised neither comes from an experienced front end developer. Also lack of financing makes it hard to release a "near perfection" version

5.- Transactions log/history in VEF isn't implemented

6.- When user adds VEF amount and it get's transformed to BTC, it should also format the VEF input if the user didn't input decimal separator and two decimals
